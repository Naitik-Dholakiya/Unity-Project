This is the README file for my Unity project featuring a grabbable object, created as part of my AR/VR Assignment-1.

### Assignment Overview:
The task was to build a basic virtual environment in Unity, which includes:
- A ground plane
- A skybox
- Environmental objects
- Lighting
- Simple VR interactions

The main interaction allows the player to grab and move objects within the environment.
